Mall Customer Segmentation

This project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to segment a mall's target market into distinct and actionable customer groups. By analyzing demographic and behavioral criteria, we aim to provide insights that enhance marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.

Customer segmentation is a fundamental technique in marketing to understand a target audience's unique needs and preferences. This project focuses on dividing a mall's customers into meaningful groups using demographic and behavioral data. By identifying these groups, the mall can implement targeted marketing activities for better engagement and ROI.

The dataset is either sourced from publicly available repositories or provided as part of a case study. Make sure to include the dataset file in the project directory under the name Mall_Customers.csv.

Project Goals

Analyze and visualize customer data to uncover trends.
Group customers using clustering techniques.
Provide actionable insights for marketing and management teams.
Technologies Used

The notebook employs the following technologies and libraries:

Python: Core programming language
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy: Numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine learning, specifically clustering algorithms like K-Means

The project successfully identifies key customer segments, such as:

High spenders with low frequency.
Younger shoppers with high engagement.
Budget-conscious customers.
These insights can help the mall optimize its marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and in-store experiences.
